# YOLOv3 Tiny trained to predict Football

* Object detection using YOLOv3 Tiny is implemented. The tiny version was chosen to keep the model light, thus providing high Frames Per Second(FPS) on mid and low end devices.
* Complete model was trained on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
* Dataset was acquired from [Open Images Dataset](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html)
* YOLOv3 Tiny was trained with [AlexeyAB's darknet framework](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet)

* Model info-
  * Iterations - 3000
  * mean Average Precision (mAP) - 72 %
* All predictions were done using **yolov3-tiny-obj_last.weights**
